# Exciting Tournament
Simulate a single-elimination arcade bracket and total the excitement generated by differences in player skill.

## Objective
Implement the tournament flow so the excitement across every match can be computed.
- Practice BST insertion.
- Practice tree traversal.

## Problem Description
An arcade in Gameland is running a single-elimination tournament with virtual tables arranged in a row. Each pair of adjacent tables has a player slot between them, and there are two additional slots at the ends, so every competitor starts at a unique position. Tables activate one at a time according to a predetermined order, and each activation selects the closest available players on its left and right to compete. The higher-skilled player always wins, the loser leaves, and the winner stays to face future challengers. Every table activates exactly once, guaranteeing N - 1 matches for N players. The excitement of a match is the absolute difference between the competitors' skills; the program must follow the activation schedule, resolve every game, and sum all excitement values.

## Input Format
- One integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 500000`) giving the number of players.
- One line with `n - 1` unique integers `a1 .. a(n-1)` (`1 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1`) describing the table activation order.
- One line with `n` unique integers `b1 .. bn` (`0 ≤ bi ≤ 1000000000`) listing player skills from leftmost to rightmost starting position.

## Output Format
- One integer equal to the total excitement across the tournament.

## Example
### Input
```text
5
1 3 4 2
5 1 4 2 3
```

### Output
```text
8
```

Following this activation schedule yields matches with excitement 4, 2, 1, and 1 for a total of 8.
